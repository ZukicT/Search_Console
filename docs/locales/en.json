    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": "What is Search Console for iOS?",
    "a1": "Search Console for iOS is a native iPhone and iPad app that connects to Google Search Console via the official API. It lets you monitor your website's search performance, view clicks, impressions, CTR, average position, analyze search queries, check Core Web Vitals, and more - all from your mobile device.",
    "q2": "Is there an official Google Search Console app?",
    "a2": "No, Google does not offer an official Search Console app for iPhone. Search Console for iOS is an independent third-party app that uses Google's official Search Console API to bring your search data to your iPhone and iPad.",
    "q3": "How do I access Google Search Console on iPhone?",
    "a3": "Download Search Console for iOS from the App Store and sign in with your Google account. The app uses secure OAuth authentication to connect to your Search Console properties. You can also use Safari to visit search.google.com/search-console, but a native app provides a much better mobile experience.",
    "q4": "What features does the app include?",
    "a4": "The app includes performance analytics (clicks, impressions, CTR, average position), search query analysis, top pages monitoring, Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP), URL inspection, sitemap management, device and country filtering, custom date ranges, interactive charts, and push notifications for performance alerts.",
    "q5": "How do I sign in?",
    "a5": "Tap \"Sign in with Google\" and use the same Google account that has access to your Search Console properties. The app uses OAuth for secure authentication - your password is never stored or accessed by the app.",
    "q6": "Is my data safe?",
    "a6": "Yes. The app connects directly to Google's official Search Console API using OAuth 2.0. Your data stays in your Google account - I don't store, collect, or have access to your Search Console data. All data shown is based on what Google collects and what you have enabled in your Google Account settings. You can <a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/data-and-privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">manage your Google privacy settings here</a>.",
    "privacyLinkText": "manage your Google privacy settings here",
    "q7": "Is this app affiliated with Google?",
    "a7": "No. Search Console for iOS is an independent third-party app. It is not made by, affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Google LLC. The app uses Google's publicly available Search Console API.",
    "q8": "Can I cancel my subscription?",
    "a8": "Yes, you can cancel anytime through iPhone Settings > your name > Subscriptions. You'll keep access until the end of your current billing period.",
    "q9": "Why is the app not free?",
    "a9": "The subscription covers continued app development and API costs. Unlike free apps that rely on ads or selling user data, Search Console for iOS has no ads and never accesses your data. Your subscription directly supports ongoing updates, new features, and improvements. Try it free for 7 days before subscribing.",
    "q10": "Why can't I see my website?",
    "a10": "Make sure your website is verified in Google Search Console on the web first. The app only shows properties you have access to in your Google account. If you recently added a site, try signing out and back in to refresh your properties.",
    "q11": "Does the app work on iPad?",
    "a11": "Yes. Search Console for iOS works on both iPhone and iPad running iOS 18.0 or later. The interface adapts to take advantage of larger iPad screens.",
    "q12": "Can I view Core Web Vitals?",
    "a12": "Yes. The app displays your Core Web Vitals including Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), and Interaction to Next Paint (INP) for both mobile and desktop.",
    "q13": "Can I manage multiple websites?",
    "a13": "Yes. All websites you have access to in Google Search Console will appear in the app. You can easily switch between them from the main screen.",
    "q14": "How often is the data updated?",
    "a14": "Data is fetched directly from Google's Search Console API each time you open the app or pull to refresh. Note that Google's Search Console data typically has a 2-3 day processing delay - this is a Google limitation, not an app limitation.",
    "q15": "What date ranges can I view?",
    "a15": "You can view data for the last 24 hours, 7 days, 28 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, or 16 months - matching the options available in Google Search Console.",
    "q16": "Is there an Android version?",
    "a16": "Not yet. I'm focused on iOS first. Sign up for updates and I'll let you know if an Android version is planned.",
    "q17": "Does it work offline?",
    "a17": "The app caches your most recent data, so you can view it offline. However, an internet connection is required to fetch new data from Google."
